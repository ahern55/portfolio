// kinda hacky, but the best way to do this now so that I don't have random pixel values floating around...
// I could not get typescript to let me access tailwind config values as in https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#referencing-in-java-script
// so here are the fun values hardcoded from https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design

export const smallScreenWidthPixels = 640;
export const mediumScreenWidthPixels = 768;
export const largeScreenWidthPixels = 1024;
export const extraLargeScreenWidthPixels = 1280;
